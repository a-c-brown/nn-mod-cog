Unfortunetaly, little was known at the time about the mammalian visual cortex that could inform Rosenblatt's work. Consequently, the photo-perceptron architecture was inspired by a very coarse idea of how the information flows from the eyeballs to be processed by the brain. This changed fast in the years following the introduction of the perceptron. \n",

This is what they did: they placed tiny microelectrode in a single neuron in the primary visual cortex (V1) of an anesthetized cat, and proyected light and dark dots into the cat's eye. It did not work at all, they could not get a response from the neuron. But, they had a lucky accident. Since they were using a slide projector to show the dots, the *margin of the slide* with the dot also was projected into the cat's ayes and bam! the neuron fired. From there, they experimented with light and dark bars in different orientations, which led them to propose the existence of **three types of cells in the visual cortex**:\n",

    "1. **simple cells**, that fire at higher (or lower) rate depending on the bar orientation. Sometimes called \"line detectors\".\n",

Then, each cell in a $S_1$ patch \"reads\" a sub-section of the input image based on a \"preference\" for certain type of pattern. Any given layer $L_n$ will have several of this $S_j$ patches as a collection of **feature \"filters\"**. Some may detect a diagonal line, while other a small triangle, or a corner, or something else. Each $S_j$ patch connects to a $C_k$ cell, and such a cell fires if gets any positive input from its corresponding patch. This process is also known as **\"pooling\"**. This cycle of \"feature\" detection and \"pooling\" is repeated as many times as intermediate layers in the network. The last layer correspond to the output, where some neuron will fire depending of the input pattern. Mathematically, \"feature detection\" is accomplished by multiplying the input by a fix matrix of weights, whereas \"pooling\" corresponding to taking an average of the connected patch of S-cells. \n",

    "You may have noticed that the behavior of the S-cells and C-cells replicate (to some extent) what Hubel and Wiesel found in their experiments. The great thing about this architecture is that is **robust to shifts in the input image**: you can move the image around and the combination of \"feature detection\" and \"pooling\" will detect the precense of each part of the image regardless of its position. **Figure X** exemplifies this characteristic."

At the time, backpropagation was not widely known as a training method for multilayer neural networks reason why Fukushima never use it, and trained his model by using an unsupervised learning approach.

Weights *within* a feature map pattern need to be identical so they can detect *the same* local feature in the input image. Weights *between* feature maps patterns are different so they can detect *different* local features. Each unit in a feature map has a **receptive field**.

Also imagine that you have a set of images that were drawn witn invisible ink. Now, you need your special flashlights to reveal the hidden character in the image.

For instance, if we know that we have a \"curvy horizontal line\" at the center-bottom, a \"curvy vertical line\" at the middle-right, a \"stright vertical line\" at upper-left, and a \"stright horizontal line\" at the center-top, we should be able to tell we have a \"5\".

Hence, we want our network to be as *insensitive as possible* to the absolute position of a feature, and as *sensitive as possible* to its relative position.

You can think on this as taking \"strides\" of a size equal to $n$, e.g., for a $3 \\times 3$ feature map, we take a stride of $3$. Then, we take weighted average of each pixel in the receptive field, and pass the resulting sum through a sigmoid function (or any other non-linear function).

For instance, the LeNet 5 paper (1998) was published in the context of the debate between traditional pattern recognition with handcrafted features vs the automated learning-based approach of neural nets. Nothing was said about human perception. However, from our perspective, the issue of **whether convolutional nets are useful model of human perception and vision** is critical. This is a open debate. Many researchers do beleive that convolutionls nets are useful models for human vision and perception, and there is a long list of [scientific articles trying to show this point](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/jocn_a_01544).

    "I'll not compute the cross-correlation values. The computation is as simple as overlaying the kernel matrix $K$ on top of the $P$ input matrix and take a weighted sum. This is the reason why you'll see most text in deep learning explain convolutions as \"sliding\" the kernel over the image taking a stride of X. Essentially, cross-correlation is a **measure of similarity** between the kernel and the input image. The better the alignment, the higher the cross-correlation value.\n",

    "Regarding the first question, technically, we could \"flatten\" the image into a long vector and use a traditional multi-layer perceptron to classify the images. Just imagine aligning each pixel $[p_{00}, p_{01}, ..., p_{ji}]$ one after the other in a long list. This is way simpler than bothering with convolution or cross-correlation. The short answer is: because the **topological information matters**. In other words, the relative position of each pixel in the grid matters, and we want to exploit such space-dependence when learning the network weights. If you train a model to recognize faces, the relative distance between *your ayes* and your *mouth* matters. Knowing that the images has a pair of eyes and a mouth is not enough. Therefore, we want to keep the grid-structure when training the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding the second question, the answer is: **no, it does not matter**. Well, it does matter in terms of the implementation, computational complexity, etc. But it does not matter in terms of finding a solution. The training algorithm will **ensure that the appropiate weights are learn** regardless. In short, when you use *convolution* the network will learn a matrix of weights $W$. If you use *cross-correlation* instead, the network will learn a set of weights $-W$, i.e., the weights \"flipped\"."
