Walter Pitts was a self-taught logician and mathematician
At some point, Pitts was homeless, and McCulloch invited him to live with his family
Then, they started to work together
Pitts was strongly influenced by Leibniz work in computing. 
Leibneiz showed that logic could be reduced to arithmetic
He created a hand-powered calculator that could perform the 4 basic perations
Since logic can be reduced to arimethic, if you can create a machine that can compute arimetich expression
by extension, you can create a machine that can do logic. 
He could not create a binary calculator for technical limitations
In reverse, If a neuron could be described as a machine that could perform any logical operation
then, the nervous system could be regarded as a computer
