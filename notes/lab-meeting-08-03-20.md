## Goal

To create an introductory level educational resource about neural network models of cognition

## Method

Describing the historical context, theory, mathematics, and code implementation of a selection of canonical neural network models of cognition. All in one interactive document.

---

## Format

Distributed as an on-line, freely available, set of interactive tutorials, bundled in a Jupyter-Book.

## Audience

Beginner-intermediate level. Advance undergrads, early stage graduate students in the cognitive and behavioral sciences.

---

## Chapters

1. Introduction to Computational Models of Cognition
2. A Roadmap to Neural Network Models of Cognition
3. The McCulloch-Pitts Artificial Neuron (McCulloch & Pitts, 1943)
4. The Perceptron (Rossenblat, 1958) â€‹
5. The ADALINE (Widrow & Hoff, 1959)
