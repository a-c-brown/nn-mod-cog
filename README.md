# Introduction to canonical neural network models of cognition

## About
The goal of this project is to introduce a selection of canonical neural network models of cognition. Each section covers the following contents:

- Historical and theoretical background
- Mathematical formalization
- Code implementation in Python
- Example application
- Model limitations

Models are implemented in Python as Jupyter Notebooks tutorials. Although is recommended to follow the tutorials in a linear fashion, they can be used as stand-alone learning material.

The tutorials are intended to be used by beginner to intermediate level students and/or researchers in cognitive science or related fields, for instance, advance undergraduates or early-stage graduate students. Knowledge of Python is not required, but it is advised to have previous exposure/experience working with some dynamically typed programming language like R, Julia, Scala, or Matlab.

## Contents

1. Introduction to Computational Models of Cognition
2. Roadmap to Neural Network Models of Cognition

4. The Perceptron (Rossenblat, 1958) â€‹
5. The Adaline - Adaptive Linear Neuron (Widrow & Hoff, 1959)
6. The Multilayer Perceptron (Rummelhart, Hinton & Williams, 1986)
7. The Convolutional Neural Network (Lecun et all, 1989; LeCun et all 1998, Krizhevsky et all, 2012)
8. The Recurrent Neural Network (Lecun et all, 1989; LeCun et all 1998, Krizhevsky et all, 2012)

## Requirements

To set up your machine,  you first need this dependencies:

- python==3.6
- git= 2.17.1
- pip >= 20.0.2

## Usage

### Remote

Click in the ```binder``` icon -> [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/pabloinsente/nn-mod-cog/5c873cbbe08443ea37e81e1e40bfe78a68f14db5)


### Locally

To run the notebooks in your machine, open the terminal and follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 0: check python 3.6.x
python --version
# if necessary, install the required python version
# consider using pyenv to manage and switch python versions safely

# Step 1: get the repository
git clone https://github.com/pabloinsente/nn-mod-cog

# Step 2: navigate into the directory
cd nn-mod-cog/

# Step 3: create virtual environment 
python3 -m venv venv

# Step 4: activate virtual environment 
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 5: check pip version >= 20.0.2
pip --version

# upgrade if necessary with
pip install --upgrade pip

# Step 6: install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 7: Run Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab ./notebooks.
```
