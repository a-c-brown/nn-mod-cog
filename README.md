# Computational models of cognition and behavior

## About

The goal of this project is to implement a selection of **canonical models in cognitive science**. Theoretical and historical remarks are added along with the mathemtical formulation and code implementation. The algorithms follow a step-by-step code implementation with the aim of maximize conceptual clarity. Models are implemented as Jupyter Notebooks.
