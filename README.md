# Computational models of cognition and behavior

Theory and implementation of canonical models of cognition and behavior.

## About

The goal of this project is to implement the algorithms step-by-step to maximize conceptual clarity. Optimized and thoroughly tested implementations of these models can be found elsewhere.  
Models are implemented as jupyter notebooks. Python scripts are also provided.

## Contents

Potential models to be implemented:

### Connectionist models

* Single-layer perceptron :heavy_check_mark:
* Multi-layer perceptron with non-linear units trained with backpropagation
* Recurrent neural network
* Convolutional neural network

### Bayesian models of cognition

* Gaussian-Gaussian process
* Hierarchical bayesian process

### Reward-based and associative learning models

* Recorla-Wagner delta-rule model
* Temporal-difference learning
